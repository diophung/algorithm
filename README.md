# Algorithm 
----------
## Divide & Conquer
- Break down the original problem to smaller pieces and solve each of them, thus solve the whole problem.

## Dynamic Programming
- Memorization, trade memory for speed.

## Bitwise operation & Logic
- Logic gates (XOR, NAND) 

## Maths
- Statistics, Probability, Computational Geometry

## Recursion
- Tail call optimization, backtrack 

## Greedy
- Minimax, Maximin


# Data Structure
----------
## Array & Matrix
- Traversal, sorting, 

## Stack / Queue
- Reversal, Peek n-th element

## Queue
- Priority queue, FIFO, LIFO

## String
- Longest unique substring, longest common substring

## Tree
- Binary tree, n-ary tree, BST, balanced vs unbalanced tree.

## Hashtable | Dictionary
- Hash function, double hashing, chain-link, hash-collision.

## Graph
- Dijkstra's shortest path, Hamilton cycle, cyclic vs non-cyclic, directed vs. non-directed, uni-directional.
