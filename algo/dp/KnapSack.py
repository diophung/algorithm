# Initial Rules:
# * The game consists of 30 cards, where each card has a Value which is a number between 0-9 and a Color which is Red, Green, or Blue (RGB)
# * Each player gets 3 cards
# * Each game consists of some number of players, and winners are determined by who has the best Combo:
#     * Color Combo (3 cards same color) - 300 pts
#     * Value Combo (3 cards same value) - 30 pts
#     * Pair Combo (2 cards with same value, and 1 random card) - 10 pts
# * Scoring: best combo points

# Write the library required to play this game.  Donâ€™t worry about UI, just create a main method to mimic the action of dealing the cards out to 10 players, score the players' hands, show (print) everyone's hand, and declare a winner.

"""
Functional-requirements
    - deal cards to X (X=10) players
    - score the hands
    - print everyone's
    - declare winner

    Assumption: 30 card, 0-9, Color can change 
    Client-side:
    - Call main function --> do all the.

    Domain entity:
    - Player
    - Game
    - Card
    - Scoreboard (?)

Non-functional requirements
- no worries about scalability right now.

Strategy pattern to swap our new role
Strategy Factory to create new strategy if needed
